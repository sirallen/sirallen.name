**The Impact of Smart Money on Retail Investors in Online Lending Marketplaces** (with [Tzuo Hann Law](http://www.tzuohann.com))  
We use novel data from [Lending Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club) to evaluate the effects of the site's market design on portfolio selection and performance for two types of investors. Part of our data is self-collected and allows us to identify whether loans were funded by retail or institutional investors, as well as how quickly those loans were funded.

**Visualizing the Structures of Large Banking Institutions**  
I made a web application with R/shiny and D3 to illuminate the complex structures of large banks and financial corporations. The underlying data is public but too difficult to analyze usefully, unless you know some tricks to parse PDF files. ([launch](https://sirallen.shinyapps.io/nicStructure))

### "Weekend" Projects

* Interactive visualization of U.S. city populations made with R package `shiny` and the `D3` Javascript library. ([launch](https://sirallen.shinyapps.io/CityTraj/)) ([github](https://github.com/sirallen/population-trajectories)) ([blog post](https://sirallen.name/blog/population-growth-trajectories-cities/))

### Some other things I'm doing

* Plowing through Andrew Ng's [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) specialization on Coursera

* Scraping golf tournament data from the web and making some cool charts. Eventually I'd like to experiment with automating the discovery of "interesting" statistics that are used to pepper live commentary. ("If player pulls off shot X, it will be the first time since Y that Z...") Currently there are poor souls who scour vast spreadsheets to find this information.
