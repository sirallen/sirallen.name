Below are some resources---essays, lectures, textbooks, and other publications---that I've found either helpful or especially interesting (or both!) and would wholeheartedly recommend to others.

## Data Science

* [_Modeling Data with Functional Programming in R_](https://cartesianfaith.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rowe-modeling-data-with-functional-programming-part-i.pdf) by Brian Lee Yung Rowe. This is only a pre-print of the first four chapters (full book to be published in 2018), but it's a great primer on leveraging R's functional programming design to write compact and efficient code. For intermediate R users.
* [_Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/) by David Robinson.
* [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. This is the book that first introduced me to machine learning three years ago, and I still use it as a reference on occasion. The focus is conceptual, with only a mild amount of math---great for mid- to upper-level undergraduates with a background in statistics.
* ["Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726) by L. Breiman (2001).

## Economics

* The [_Journal of Economic Perspectives_](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep). Great collection of articles on core ideas and developments covering a wide swath of economics.
* [_Reports and Issue Briefs_](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/cea/factsheets-reports) of the Council of Economic Advisers.
* ["The Republic of Beliefs: A New Approach to Law and Economics"](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/304281468189241748/pdf/WPS7259.pdf) by Kaushik Basu (2015).
* ["An Invitation to Market Design"](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/18-019_b138aaa9-55f6-484e-a7c5-84b31ed71759.pdf) by Kominers, Teytelboym, and Crawford (2017).
* ["The Unfavorable Economics of Measuring the Returns to Advertising"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2367103) by Lewis and Rao (2014).

## Math

* [Expository Papers](http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/) on abstract algebra by Keith Conrad.
* ["Who Can Name the Bigger Number?"](https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html) by Scott Aaronson.
