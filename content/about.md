Welcome to my new blog and personal site! My name is Allen Sirolly. I'm a newly minted data scientist at [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/), a Silicon Valley company which provides software-based solutions to personal financial planning and investment management. I previously completed a two-year stint at the Federal Reserve (Richmond), where I helped research economists build fancy models and make sense of complex data.

I have a BA in Mathematical Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, with minors in Statistics and Political Science. I'm broadly interested in data science, economics, and U.S. and Chinese current affairs. I try to keep tabs on all of these things and more on a cool website called [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sirallenrolly), where you can check out the list of people I follow for a fuller picture of my interests.

When I'm not studying or working on my projects, I'm usually at the golf course trying to sharpen my game. Ping me if you want to tee it up!

This site is built with blogdown and Hugo and deployed with Netlify. The minimalist theme is based on [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy) by Darren Mulholland. I'm using a version for Hugo ([hugo-ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy)) made by Yihui Xie, who also made blogdown and many other wonderful tools for R.
