Welcome to my new blog and personal site! My name is Allen Sirolly. I recently finished a two-year stint at the Federal Reserve (Richmond), where I helped research economists build fancy models and make sense of complex data. I'm currently looking for work as a data scientist while hammering out progress on several personal projects.

I have a BA in Mathematical Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, with minors in Statistics and Political Science. I'm broadly interested in data science, economics, and U.S. and Chinese current affairs. I try to keep tabs on all of these things and more on Twitter, where you can find me [@Sirallenrolly](https://twitter.com/Sirallenrolly). (The list of people I follow probably gives a more comprehensive picture of my interests.)

When I'm not programming or studying, I'm usually at the golf course working to sharpen my game. Ping me if you want to tee it up!

This site is built with blogdown and Hugo and deployed with Netlify. The minimalist theme is based on [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy) by Darren Mulholland. I'm using a version for Hugo made by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy), who also made blogdown and many other wonderful tools for R.
