Welcome to my blog and personal site! My name is Allen and I'm currently a PhD student in the Decision, Risk, and Operations (DRO) division of Columbia Business School. I was previously a data scientist at [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/), a Silicon Valley company which provides software-based solutions to personal financial planning and investment management.

I have a BA in Mathematical Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, with minors in Statistics and Political Science. I'm broadly interested in data science, economics, and U.S. and Chinese current affairs. I try to keep tabs on all of these things and more on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allensirolly), where you can find a more comprehensive view of my interests. I'm also active on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7468726?ref=nav_mybooks) and [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/65957873).

This site is built with blogdown and Hugo and deployed with Netlify. The minimalist theme is based on [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy) by Darren Mulholland. I'm using a version for Hugo ([hugo-ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy)) made by Yihui Xie, who also made blogdown and many other wonderful tools for R.
