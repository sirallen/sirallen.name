<p><em>This post is a supplement to <a href="https://sirallen.name/blog/note-on-lending-club/">A Note on Lending Club and Institutional Investment</a>, which shows that institutional investors tend to fund loans that will be prepaid. Below is a short mathematical justification for why it makes sense for them to do so, given Lending Club’s policy on servicing fees.</em></p>
<p>Suppose we’d like to compute the internal rate of return (IRR) for a loan investment based on two different fee schemes. The first (call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span>) charges a fee <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> in proportion to each period’s outstanding principal balance, while the second (<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span>) charges a fee <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> on all payments by the borrower. The borrower can “prepay” a loan with term <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by paying off the entire principal in <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; T\)</span> months. Given initial principal <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, monthly interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, payment periods <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and payment sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}_{i=1}^m\)</span>, the principal amortizes according to <span class="math display">\[
P_i = (1+r)P_{i-1} - A_i = (1+r)^i P_0 - \sum_{j=1}^i (1+r)^{j-1} A_j
\]</span> and the corresponding IRRs <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> satisfy <span class="math display">\[
P_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{R_1}{12} \right)^{-i} (A_i - s_1 P_i) \\
P_0 = (1 - s_2) \sum_{i=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{12} \right)^{-i} A_i.
\]</span> First assuming constant monthly payments given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
A_i = P_0 \frac{r(1+r)^m}{(1+r)^m - 1} \equiv A,
\]</span> we can use the following code to see how <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> vary with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Note that by construction, i.e., by the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(P_m = 0\)</span>. Also note that the result doesn’t depend on <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> (it can be normalized to 1), though I’ve kept it to make the calculations more explicit.</p>

<p>The test case below is a loan with $1000 principal (again, doesn’t matter) and 15% annual interest rate, with fees <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> equal to 1.3% per annum and 1%, respectively. (According to Lending Club’s policy for whole loans, <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is variable but 1.3% per annum is the <em>highest</em> servicing fee it will charge.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Returns for institutional (whole loan) investors

<p>This isn’t a complete picture since it doesn’t account for returns from reinvestment (purchasing new Notes or whole loans after receiving each <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>, which can be done recursively). But it’s clear that investors who are charged fees under scheme <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span> can achieve a higher return with early payment, i.e., <code>$ \Delta_m R_1 &lt; 0$</code>. In contrast, early payment is a suboptimal outcome under scheme <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can’t yet declare the matter settled as there’s a potential problem with the above graph. Empirically, given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the borrower tends to back-load prepayment to later periods, so the assumption of fixed payments isn’t very realistic. (I checked this using Lending Club’s payments data, but I’ll defer the evidence to a future post.) A more realistic flow of payments would be constant installments for <span class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> periods (computed with the formula for <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> using the loan term <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in place of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, which gives the <em>minimum</em> amount the borrower must pay each month), and one large payment to expunge all outstanding principal (with interest) in period <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s straightforward to modify the functions above to accomodate non-constant payments:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>P_i = Vectorize(
  # Compute outstanding principal after i payments
  function(A_seq, P0, r, i) {
    # A_seq -- sequence of payments (length m)
    if (i==0) return(P0)
    (1 + r)^i * P0 - sum(A_seq[1:i] * (1 + r)^(0:(i-1)))
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;i&#39;)

gen_A_seq = function(P0, r, m, Term=36) {
  # Sequence of m - 1 installments, plus final payment (1+r)*P_{m-1}
  Inst = A(P0, r, Term)
  A_seq = rep(Inst, m - 1)
  c(A_seq, (1 + r) * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, m - 1))
}

R1 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m) {
    # s -- service fee rate (monthly, on remaining principal)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    fun = function(z) (P0 - sum((1 + z/12)^-(1:m) *
                                  (A_seq - s * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, 1:m))))^2
    # solve for IRR
    optimize(fun, interval=c(0, .5))$minimum
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

R2 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m=36) {
    # s  -- service fee rate (monthly, on payments)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    fun = function(z) (P0 - sum((1 + z/12)^-(1:m) *
                                  (1 - s) * A_seq))^2
    # solve for IRR
    optimize(fun, interval=c(0, .5))$minimum
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

# Returns for institutional (whole loan) investors
r_inst = R1(s=.013/12, P0=1000, r=.15/12, m=1:36)

# Returns for retail (Note) investors
r_ret  = R2(s=.01, P0=1000, r=.15/12, m=1:36)

matplot(1:36, cbind(r_inst, r_ret), las=1, type=&#39;l&#39;,
        xlab=&#39;Months until full payment (m)&#39;,
        ylab=&#39;Internal rate of return&#39;)
legend(&#39;bottomright&#39;, c(&#39;R1&#39;,&#39;R2&#39;), lty=c(1,2), col=c(&#39;black&#39;,&#39;red&#39;),

<p>With this more realistic payment sequence, the picture looks very similar—the endpoints of the two curves are the same as before since the two versions of <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span> are identical for <span class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = T\)</span>. An investor would still benefit from early payment under <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span>, though the “penalty” on returns of one additional month—corresponding to the slope of the curve—is slightly larger for small <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The curvature of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span> is also a little bit more pronounced; notice the shift in the point of intersection.</p>
