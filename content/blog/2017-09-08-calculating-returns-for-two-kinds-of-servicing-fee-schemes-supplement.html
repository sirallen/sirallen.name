<p><em>This post is a supplement to <a href="https://sirallen.name/blog/note-on-lending-club/">A Note on Lending Club and Institutional Investment</a>.</em></p>
<p>Suppose we’d like to compute ROI for a loan investment based on two different fee schemes. The first (call it <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>) charges a fee <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> in proportion to each period’s outstanding principal balance, while the second (<span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>) charges a fee <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> on all payments by the borrower. The borrower can “prepay” a loan with term <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by paying off the entire principal in <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; T\)</span> months. Given initial principal <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, monthly interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, payment periods <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and payment sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}_{i=1}^m\)</span>, the corresponding annualized returns are <span class="math display">\[
R_1 = \left[ 1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (A_i - s_1 P_i) - P_0}{P_0} \right]^{12/m} - 1 \\
R_2 = \left[ 1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (1 - s_2) A_i - P_0}{P_0} \right]^{12/m} - 1
\]</span></p>
<p>First assuming constant monthly payments given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
A_i = P_0 \frac{r(1+r)^m}{(1+r)^m - 1} \equiv A,
\]</span> we can use the following code to see how <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> vary with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (Technically <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> isn’t needed, but I’ve kept it to make the calculations more explicit.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>A = function(P0, r, m) {
  # P0 -- initial principal
  # r  -- interest rate (monthly)
  # m  -- number of payment periods
  P0 * r * (1 + r)^m / ((1 + r)^m - 1)
}

P_i = Vectorize(
  # Compute outstanding principal after i payments
  function(A, P0, r, i) {
    if (i==0) return(P0)
    (1 + r)^i * P0 - A * sum((1 + r)^(0:(i-1)))
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;i&#39;)

R1 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m) {
    # s -- service fee rate (monthly, on remaining principal)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_ = A(P0, r, m)
    R = (sum(A_ - s * P_i(A_, P0, r, 1:m)) - P0) / P0
    # annualize
    (1 + R)^(12/m) - 1
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

R2 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m) {
    # s  -- service fee rate (monthly, on payments)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    R = (m * (1 - s) * A(P0, r, m) - P0) / P0
    # annualize
    (1 + R)^(12/m) - 1
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The test case below is a loan with $1000 principal (again, doesn’t matter) and 15% annual interest rate, with fees <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> equal to 1.3% per annum and 1%, respectively. (According to Lending Club’s policy for whole loans, <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> is variable but 1.3% per annum is the <em>highest</em> servicing fee it will charge.)</p>

<p>This isn’t a complete picture since it doesn’t account for returns from reinvestment (purchasing new Notes or whole loans after receiving each <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>, which can be done recursively).<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> But it’s clear that investors who are charged fees under scheme <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> can achieve higher ROI with early payment, i.e., <code>$ \Delta_m R_1 &lt; 0$</code>. In contrast, early payment is a suboptimal outcome under scheme <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can’t yet declare the matter settled, since there’s a potential problem with the above graph. Empirically, given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the borrower tends to back-load prepayment to later periods, so the assumption of fixed payments isn’t very realistic. (I checked this using Lending Club’s payments data, but I’ll defer the evidence to a future post.) A more realistic flow of payments would be constant installments for <span class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> periods (computed with the amortization formula using the loan term <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in place of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, which gives the <em>minimum</em> amount the borrower must pay each month), and one large payment to expunge all outstanding principal (with interest) in period <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s straightforward to modify some of the functions above to accomodate non-constant payments:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>P_i = Vectorize(
  # Compute outstanding principal after i payments
  function(A_seq, P0, r, i) {
    # A_seq -- sequence of payments (length m)
    if (i==0) return(P0)
    (1 + r)^i * P0 - sum(A_seq[1:i] * (1 + r)^(0:(i-1)))
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;i&#39;)

gen_A_seq = function(P0, r, m, Term=36) {
  # Sequence of m - 1 installments, plus final payment (1+r)*P_{m-1}
  Inst = A(P0, r, Term)
  A_seq = rep(Inst, m - 1)
  c(A_seq, (1 + r) * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, m - 1))
}

R1 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m) {
    # s -- service fee rate (monthly, on remaining principal)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    R = (sum(A_seq) - s * sum(P_i(A_seq, P0, r, 1:m)) - P0) / P0
    # annualize
    (1 + R)^(12/m) - 1
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

R2 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m=36) {
    # s  -- service fee rate (monthly, on payments)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    R = ((1 - s) * sum(A_seq) - P0) / P0
    # annualize
    (1 + R)^(12/m) - 1
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

# Returns for institutional (whole loan) investors
r_inst = R1(s=.013/12, P0=1000, r=.15/12, m=1:36)

# Returns for retail (Note) investors
r_ret  = R2(s=.01, P0=1000, r=.15/12, m=1:36)

matplot(1:36, cbind(r_inst, r_ret), las=1, type=&#39;l&#39;,
        xlab=&#39;Months until full payment (m)&#39;,
        ylab=&#39;Annualized returns&#39;)

<p>With this more realistic payment sequence, an investor would still prefer early payment under <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>, though the “penalty” on ROI of one additional month—corresponding to the slope of the curve—is not as pronounced for small <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Interestingly, the curve corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> attains an interior maximum, suggesting that a Note investor might be best off if the borrower prepays, but not <em>too</em> early.</p>
