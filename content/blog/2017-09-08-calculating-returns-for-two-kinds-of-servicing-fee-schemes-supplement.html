<p><em>This post is a supplement to <a href="https://sirallen.name/blog/note-on-lending-club/">A Note on Lending Club and Institutional Investment</a>, which shows that institutional investors tend to fund loans that will be prepaid. Below is a short mathematical justification for why it makes sense for them to do so, given Lending Club’s policy on servicing fees. I also include retail investors for comparison.</em></p>
<p>Suppose we’d like to compute the internal rate of return<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (IRR) for a loan investment based on two different fee schemes. The first (call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span>) charges a fee <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> in proportion to each period’s outstanding principal balance, while the second (<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span>) charges a fee <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> on all payments by the borrower, up to the contractual monthly payment in the first 12 months.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span> represent fees levied on institutional (whole loan) investors and retail (Note) investors, respectively.) The borrower can “prepay” a loan with term <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by paying off the entire principal in <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; T\)</span> months. Given initial principal <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, monthly interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, payment periods <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and payment sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}_{i=1}^m\)</span>, the principal amortizes according to <span class="math display">\[
P_i = (1+r)P_{i-1} - A_i = (1+r)^i P_0 - \sum_{j=1}^i (1+r)^{i-j} A_j
\]</span> and the corresponding IRRs <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> satisfy <span class="math display">\[
P_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{R_1}{12} \right)^{-i} (A_i - s_1 P_i) \\
P_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{12} \right)^{-i} \big(A_i - s_2 Y_i \big),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \min(I, A_i)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(i \leq 12\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> otherwise, and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the <em>installment</em> (or minimum payment) given by <span class="math display">\[
I = P_0 \frac{r(1+r)^T}{(1+r)^T - 1}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that in the amortization formula, <span class="math inline">\(P_i\)</span> represents the principal at the “end” of period <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, i.e., after payment <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> is made. I deliberately modeled it this way since <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span> fees are calculated on end-of-month principal, per Lending Club policy.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I also assume that payments are large enough to at least cover interest, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(A_i \geq rP_i\)</span>, as the principal can never increase.</p>
<p>Now all that remains is to specify <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span>. First assuming constant monthly payments given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
A_i = P_0 \frac{r(1+r)^m}{(1+r)^m - 1} \equiv A,
\]</span> we can use the following code to see how <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> vary with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Note that by construction, i.e., by the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(P_m = 0\)</span>. Also note that the result doesn’t depend on <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, though I’ve kept it to make the calculations more explicit.</p>

<p>The test case below is a loan with $1000 principal and 15% annual interest rate, with fees <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> equal to 1.3% per annum and 1%, respectively. (According to Lending Club’s policy for whole loans, <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is variable but 1.3% per annum is the <em>highest</em> servicing fee it will charge. A lower <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> will increase <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>, up to the interest rate when <span class="math inline">\(s_1 = 0\)</span>.)</p>

<p>This isn’t a complete picture since it doesn’t account for returns from reinvestment (purchasing new Notes or whole loans after receiving each <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>, which can be done recursively). But it’s clear that investors who are charged fees under scheme <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span> can achieve a higher return with early payment, i.e., <code>$ \Delta_m R_1 &lt; 0$</code>. The gains are relatively small but may be significant for investors with very large portfolios. With prepayment protection, early payment is also the most desirable outcome under scheme <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span>, although the curve is upward-sloping for <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; 17\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can’t yet declare the matter settled as there’s a potential problem with the above graph. Empirically, given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the borrower tends to back-load prepayment to later periods, so the assumption of fixed payments isn’t very realistic. (I checked this using Lending Club’s payments data, but I’ll defer the evidence to a future post.) A more realistic flow of payments would be constant installments for <span class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> periods and one large payment to expunge all outstanding principal (with interest) in period <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s straightforward to modify the functions above to accomodate non-constant payments:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>P_i = Vectorize(
  # Compute outstanding principal after i payments
  function(A_seq, P0, r, i) {
    # A_seq -- sequence of payments (length m)
    if (i==0) return(P0)
    (1 + r)^i * P0 - sum(A_seq[1:i] * (1 + r)^((i-1):0))
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;i&#39;)

gen_A_seq = function(P0, r, m, Term=36) {
  # Sequence of m - 1 installments, plus final payment (1+r)*P_{m-1}
  Inst = A(P0, r, Term)
  A_seq = rep(Inst, m - 1)
  c(A_seq, (1 + r) * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, m - 1))
}

R1 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m) {
    # s -- service fee rate (monthly, on remaining principal)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    fun = function(z) (P0 - sum((1 + z/12)^-(1:m) *
                                  (A_seq - s * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, 1:m))))^2
    # solve for IRR
    optimize(fun, interval=c(0, .5))$minimum
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

R2 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m=36) {
    # s  -- service fee rate (monthly, on payments)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    Y_seq = replace(A_seq, 1:min(m, 12), A(P0, r, 36))
    fun = function(z) (P0 - sum((1 + z/12)^-(1:m) *
                                  (A_seq - s * Y_seq)))^2
    # solve for IRR
    optimize(fun, interval=c(0, .5))$minimum
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

# Returns for institutional (whole loan) investors

# Returns for retail (Note) investors

matplot(1:36, cbind(r_inst, r_ret), las=1, type=&#39;l&#39;,

<p>With this more realistic payment sequence, an investor will still desire early payment under <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span>, although he will face strictly lower returns for all <span class="math inline">\(m \notin \{1, 36\}\)</span>. In particular, the slope of the curve <span class="math inline">\(R_1(m)\)</span> is even more severe for small <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, corresponding to a larger “penalty” on returns of one additional month. In contrast, returns are higher under <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(m \leq 12\)</span>, although <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; 12\)</span> yields lower returns since prepayment protection will not extend to the large final payment. Note that the endpoints of the two curves are the same as before since the two versions of <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span> are identical for <span class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = T\)</span>.</p>
<p>To give a better sense of the role of prepayment protection, I’ll add a line for a scheme (call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_2^a\)</span>) which charges a 1% fee on all borrower payments. The difference is stark:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>R2a = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m=36) {
    # s  -- service fee rate (monthly, on payments)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m)
    fun = function(z) (P0 - sum((1 + z/12)^-(1:m) *
                                  (1 - s) * A_seq))^2
    # solve for IRR
    optimize(fun, interval=c(0, .5))$minimum
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)

# Returns for retail (Note) investors, no prepayment protection
r_ret_no_protection = R2a(s=.01, P0=1000, r=.15/12, m=1:36)

matplot(1:36, cbind(r_inst, r_ret, r_ret_no_protection), las=1, type=&#39;l&#39;,
        col=c(&#39;black&#39;,&#39;red&#39;,&#39;darkred&#39;),
        xlab=&#39;Months until full payment (m)&#39;,
        ylab=&#39;Internal rate of return&#39;)

<p>Keep in mind that these examples only evaluate ex-post returns; when an investor is actually choosing loans on Lending Club, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span> are unknown and there is non-negligible risk of borrower default. If prepayment and default are both correlated with variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then selecting on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> may diminish gains from prepayment compared to above.</p>
