<p><em>This post is a supplement to <a href="https://sirallen.name/blog/calculating-returns-for-two-kinds-of-servicing-fee-schemes-supplement/">Calculating Returns for Two Kinds of Servicing Fee Schemes</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the previous post I explored the question of why an investor in Lending Club loans may desire early payment by the borrower, conditional on how servicing fees are levied as well as on the sequence of payments <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span>. I assumed a couple of “simple” instances of <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span> to make my case, but it’s easy to imagine the more general question of what the <em>best</em> <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span> an investor could hope for, given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, might be. From an investing standpoint, this isn’t really a useful question to ask—after all, investors don’t get to choose how the borrower repays. But it sounds like it might be an interesting math problem, so why not?</p>
<p>Formally, given <span class="math inline">\((P_0, r, m, T)\)</span> we’d like to know what sequence of payments <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}_{i=1}^m\)</span> maximizes the investor’s (nominal) IRR, where principal amortizes according to <span class="math display">\[
P_i = (1 + r)P_{i-1} - A_i = (1+r)^i P_0 - \sum_{j=1}^i (1+r)^{i-j} A_j.
\]</span> In addition, there are constraints <span class="math inline">\(P_m = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_i \geq I\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i \neq m\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the <em>installment</em> <span class="math display">\[
I = P_0 \frac{r(1+r)^T}{(1+r)^T - 1}.
\]</span></p>
<p>For the last period, all we need is for the borrower to pay down the remaining principal, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(A_m = (1 + r)P_{m-1}\)</span>, even if <span class="math inline">\((1+r)P_{m-1} &lt; I\)</span>. To make the problem a bit simpler, let’s tack on an explicit constraint <span class="math inline">\(A_m \geq x\)</span> for some small amount <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>—say, $1—instead of allowing <span class="math inline">\(A_m\)</span> to be arbitrarily small.</p>
<p>With respect to investor fees, let’s consider <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_1\)</span> since it’s suggestive of a dynamic tradeoff between fees and interest: on the one hand, the investor would like the principal to amortize quickly to decrease fees, but on the other hand would like it to remain high to earn more interest. The objective, then, is to maximize <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> satisfying <span class="math display">\[
P_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \left( 1 + \frac{R_1}{12} \right)^{-i} (A_i - s_1 P_i).
\]</span></p>
<p>I already considered two possibilities in the previous post: (1) constant payments <span class="math inline">\(A_i \equiv A\)</span> and (2) <span class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> installments followed by a large <span class="math inline">\(A_m\)</span>. Before trying to find the optimal sequence, let’s take a look at the possibility of (3) a large <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> followed by the minimum allowable payments in the remaining <span class="math inline">\(m - 1\)</span> periods. For <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; 1\)</span> the initial payment can be calculated by first considering a “simpler” sequence of large <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{A}_1\)</span> followed by <span class="math inline">\(m - 1\)</span> installments. <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{A}_1\)</span> needs to be such that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{P}_1\)</span> can be paid down in exactly <span class="math inline">\(m - 1\)</span> installments, i.e., <span class="math display">\[
I = \tilde{P}_1 \frac{r(1+r)^{m-1}}{(1+r)^{m-1} - 1}.
\]</span> Then (after some algebra) <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{P}_1 = P_0 \frac{(1+r)^T - (1+r)^{T-m+1}}{(1+r)^T - 1}
\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{A}_1 = (1+r)P_0 - \tilde{P}_1\)</span>. We can then transfer <span class="math inline">\(I - x\)</span> of payment <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{A}_m\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{A}_1\)</span> at rate <span class="math inline">\(1/(1+r)^{m-1}\)</span>, so that <span class="math display">\[
A_1 = \tilde{A}_1 + \frac{I - x}{(1+r)^{m-1}}.
\]</span> (If this isn’t apparent, read on for an explanation.)</p>
<p>We can reuse the functions from the previous post, modifying <code>gen_A_seq</code> accordingly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>A = function(P0, r, m) {
  # P0 -- initial principal
  # r  -- interest rate (monthly)
  # m  -- number of payment periods
  P0 * r * (1 + r)^m / ((1 + r)^m - 1)
}

P_i = Vectorize(
  # Compute outstanding principal after i payments
  function(A_seq, P0, r, i) {
    # A_seq -- sequence of payments (length m)
    if (i==0) return(P0)
    (1 + r)^i * P0 - sum(A_seq[1:i] * (1 + r)^((i-1):0))
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;i&#39;)

gen_A_seq = function(P0, r, m, Term=36, k) {
  # k -- switch number
  switch(
    k, {
      # 1 -- Constant payments
      rep(A(P0, r, m), m)
    }, {
      # 2 -- m - 1 installments followed by large A_m
      Inst = A(P0, r, Term)
      A_seq = rep(Inst, m - 1)
      c(A_seq, (1 + r) * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, m - 1))
    }, {
      # 3 -- Large A_1, if (m &gt; 1) m - 2 installments, A_m = 1
      if (m==1) return((1 + r) * P0)
      Inst = A(P0, r, Term)
      P1  = P0 * ((1 + r)^Term - (1 + r)^(Term - m + 1)) / ((1 + r)^Term - 1)
      A1 = (1 + r)*P0 - P1 + (Inst - 1) / (1 + r)^(m-1)
      c(A1, rep(Inst, m - 2), 1)
    }
  )
}

R1 = Vectorize(
  function(s, P0, r, m, k) {
    # s -- service fee rate (monthly, on remaining principal)
    # P0, r, m -- args to A()
    # k -- switch number (payment sequence 1, 2, or 3)
    A_seq = gen_A_seq(P0, r, m, k=k)
    fun = function(z) (P0 - sum((1 + z/12)^-(1:m) *
                                  (A_seq - s * P_i(A_seq, P0, r, 1:m))))^2
    # solve for IRR
    optimize(fun, interval=c(0, .5))$minimum
  },
  vectorize.args = &#39;m&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Also keeping with the previous post, let’s make the test case a loan with $1000 principal and 15% annual interest rate, with service fee rate <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> equal to 1.3% per annum.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Compute the IRR for each m, for each sequence -- 36 x 3 matrix
IRR = sapply(1:3, function(k) R1(s=.013/12, P0=1000, r=.15/12, m=1:36, k))

matplot(1:36, IRR, las=1, type=&#39;l&#39;,
        xlab=&#39;Months until full payment (m)&#39;,
        ylab=&#39;Internal rate of return&#39;)

<p>Sequence (3) is rather extreme in that payment is front-loaded as much as possible without violating any of the constraints. As it turns out, it is also optimal. To prove it, I’ll use (3) as a starting point and show that moving part of payment <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> downstream to <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span> (the only permissible action since only <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is not already bound by a constraint) cannot increase <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>. Since any permissible <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}\)</span> (given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) can be constructed starting from (3) and redistributing payment from <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, it will follow that (3) must be the optimal sequence.</p>
<p>Let me first introduce the notation <span class="math inline">\(dX/dA_{i \rightarrow j}\)</span> to describe the marginal change in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> from transferring a marginal amount of <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>, holding all other payments fixed, and in such a way that the constraint <span class="math inline">\(P_m = 0\)</span> remains satisfied. The claim, then, is that <span class="math inline">\(dR_1/dA_{1 \rightarrow j} \leq 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; j \leq m\)</span>.</p>
<p>Importantly, <span class="math inline">\(A_{i \rightarrow j}\)</span> cannot be 1:1 due to compounding. In particular, while <span class="math inline">\(dA_i/dA_{i \rightarrow j} = -1\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\frac{dA_j}{dA_{i \rightarrow j}} = (1+r) \frac{dP_{j-1}}{dA_i} = (1 + r)^{j-i}.
\]</span> This ensures that <span class="math inline">\(P_j\)</span> remains unchanged, and therefore that the remaining payments <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}_{i &gt; j}\)</span> still lead to <span class="math inline">\(P_m = 0\)</span>. (To avoid ambiguity, define <span class="math inline">\(dA_j/dA_{i \rightarrow j} = 0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(j=i\)</span>.)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Calculating <span class="math inline">\(dR_1/dA_{1 \rightarrow j}\)</span> is a little bit tricky because <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> is defined implicitly in the objective function; we’ll need to use <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivatives-advanced/ab-implicit-diff/v/implicit-differentiation-1">implicit differentiation</a>. Taking derivatives of both sides of the objective function (defining <span class="math inline">\(\beta = (1 + R_1/12)^{-1}\)</span> to simplify notation) and rearranging yields <span class="math display">\[
\frac{dR_1}{dA_{1 \rightarrow j}} = \frac{
-\beta + \beta^j (1+r)^{j-1} - s_1 \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \beta^i (1+r)^{i-1}}{
\frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^m i \beta^{i+1} (A_i - s_1 P_i)
}
\]</span> (See <a href="">here</a> for a step-by-step derivation.) Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is not too large so that the denominator is positive, <span class="math inline">\(dR_1/dA_{1 \rightarrow j} \leq 0\)</span> when the numerator is non-positive, i.e., when <span class="math display">\[
z^{j-1} - s_1 \frac{1 - z^{j-1}}{1 - z} \leq 1,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z = \beta(1+r)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> cannot be higher than the interest rate, <span class="math inline">\(z \geq 1\)</span>, and the above inequality can be rearranged to <span class="math inline">\(s_1 \geq 1 - z\)</span>, which always holds as <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is assumed to be non-negative. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(dR_1/dA_{1 \rightarrow j} \leq 0\)</span> unconditionally for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, with strict inequality if <span class="math inline">\(s_1 &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
