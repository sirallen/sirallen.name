<p>The chart below from a 2019 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/09/a-majority-of-u-s-colleges-admit-most-students-who-apply/">Pew Research article</a> caught my attention the other day. It shows a concerning trend of increasing selectivity at colleges which has been written about in a number of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-hard-to-get-into-harvard-stanford-2017-4">other</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/us/college-admissions-rates.html">places</a> as well.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The article reports that the average number of applications per enrollee increased from about four in 2002 to 6.8 in 2017, with the increase likely even more severe for competitive colleges. While this doesn’t necessarily make it “harder” to get into these schools (it could just be that more students who would have been non-competitive in previous years are applying), the rise in the average number of applications per applicant can certainly bring with it a concomitant increase in anxiety for successive waves of prospects.</p>

<p>My goal is to build a model for a multi-period college admissions market which, through some mechanism, gives rise to a vicious cycle of increasing application volume and lower admission rates. This is a big task which I don’t expect to fully accomplish here; instead, I’ll use this post to sketch out a simple “toy model” which might serve as a starting point. The main idea is that applicants shrink their beliefs about their chances of admission toward a public signal, such as last year’s admission rates, in such a way that the resulting admission rates will be slightly lower <em>this year</em>. I’ll start by considering a one-period model where applicants solve a utility maximization problem.</p>
<div id="the-model" class="section level2">
<h2>The Model</h2>
<div id="colleges" class="section level3">
<h3>Colleges</h3>
<p>Suppose there is an ordered set of colleges <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}\)</span> indexed by <span class="math inline">\(k = 1, \dots, K\)</span>. Each has capacity <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span> for an entering freshman class. Colleges receive reports of <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span> (a noisy signal of applicant <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s ability/“type” <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span>) from all applicants and must decide whom to admit based on capacity and expected yield. Colleges prefer applicant <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to applicant <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i &gt; \widetilde{W}_j\)</span>, and applicants prefer college <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; k&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>To compute the results of an admissions round, I pretend that decisions are made sequentially and publicly, such that college <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> observes the matches of all higher-ranked colleges (<span class="math inline">\(k&#39; &lt; k\)</span>). The admissions process follows a simple algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The top-ranked college sorts its applicants by <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span> (descending) and admits the top students up to capacity <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> (all of whom match with it, for a 100% yield);</p></li>
<li><p>The second-ranked college sorts its applicants by <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span> and admits all who were admitted by the first-ranked college, plus the top students who were not admitted by the first-ranked college, up to capacity <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>And so on for <span class="math inline">\(k = 3, \dots, K\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The embedded assumptions are that (a) colleges do not have minimum requirements for <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span> and (b) colleges will not reject applicants for being “overqualified”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (in the sense of having a <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span> higher than another admit).</p>
</div>
<div id="applicants" class="section level3">
<h3>Applicants</h3>
<div id="the-choice-problem" class="section level4">
<h4>The choice problem</h4>
<p>Each applicant <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has utility function <span class="math inline">\(u_i(k)\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}\)</span> and faces a constant application cost <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Each has an ability (“type”) <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span> and beliefs—shaped by priors and public information—about the probability of acceptance to college <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span>. The problem the applicant faces is to choose a set of colleges <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span> to which to apply; from the subset of admittances, the applicant will choose the college which maximizes utility. Assume that the utility of not being admitted to any college is normalized to 0, with <span class="math inline">\(u_i(k) &gt; 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{P}(S)\)</span> denote the power set of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(C_i \in \mathscr{P}(\mathcal{K})\)</span> are the possible application/choice sets<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} \in \mathscr{P}(C_i)\)</span> are the possible sets of colleges to which the applicant is admitted. Formally, an applicant will solve</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\max_{C_i \in \mathscr{P}(\mathcal{K})} \Bigg\{ \sum_{\mathcal{S} \in \mathscr{P}(C_i)} P_i(\mathcal{S}) \cdot \max_{k \in \mathcal{S}} u_i(k) - c |C_i| \Bigg\}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P_i(\mathcal{S})\)</span> is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is admitted to colleges in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and rejected from colleges in <span class="math inline">\(C_i \setminus \mathcal{S}\)</span>. Applicants believe that admissions decisions by colleges are independent, so that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_i(\mathcal{S}) = \prod_{k \in \mathcal{S}} P(\text{admit at }k \mid W_i) \prod_{k \in C_i\setminus\mathcal{S}} (1 - P(\text{admit at }k \mid W_i)).
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{P}(\mathcal{K})\)</span> is potentially a very large search space; I simplify the problem by using a greedy algorithm which at each step (starting from <span class="math inline">\(C_i = \varnothing\)</span>) adds the college <span class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span> which yields the highest increase in expected utility, provided there is one. Note that by adding <span class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span>, an applicant’s expected utility will change by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(\text{admit at }k&#39; \mid W_i) \left[ \sum_{\mathcal{S} \in \mathscr{P}(C_i)} P_i(\mathcal{S}) \cdot \max\{0,\; u_i(k&#39;) - \max_{k \in \mathcal{S}} u_i(k)\} \right] - c
\]</span></p>
<p>This expression can be simplified by considering each “best option” in <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span> to which <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> may be admitted:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(\text{admit at }k&#39; \mid W_i) \left[ P_i(\varnothing) u_i(k&#39;) + \sum_{k \in C_i} P_i(k \text{ is best option}) \cdot \max\{0,\; u_i(k&#39;) - u_i(k) \} \right] - c
\]</span></p>
<p>The corresponding probabilities are easy to compute by the independent admissions assumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="beliefs" class="section level4">
<h4>Beliefs</h4>
<p>Suppose that types are distributed <span class="math inline">\(W \sim G(w)\)</span>. Each applicant knows her own type as well as the distribution <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and sends colleges a noisy signal <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i = W_i + \epsilon_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \sim F(\epsilon)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is known but the realization of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is unknown. I assume that prior beliefs are consistent with a view of the admissions process as a perfect sorting mechanism, such that the <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j\leq k} A_j\)</span> applicants with the highest <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span>’s will be admitted to the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> highest-ranked colleges. (This actually agrees with the outcome of the colleges’ decision process if every prospect sends an application to every college, which is what happens when <span class="math inline">\(c = 0\)</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{G}\)</span> be the marginal distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i\)</span> (which applicants can calculate using knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>). After observing public information <span class="math inline">\(I_k\)</span>, e.g., last year’s admission rate at college <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the posterior beliefs are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_\alpha(\text{admit at }k \mid W_i) = (1 - \alpha) P\left( 1 - \widetilde{G}(\widetilde{W}_i) &lt; \frac{\sum_{j\leq k}A_j}{\sum_j A_j} \right) + \alpha I_k
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in [0, 1]\)</span> represents the degree of shrinkage. There are certainly other possibilities: maybe it’s more realistic that applicants only update their beliefs to make themselves overconfident about their chances at more selective colleges.</p>
<p>One challenging problem (which I won’t attempt in this post) is to figure out the beliefs and utility functions which result in an admissions outcome that is consistent with <span class="math inline">\(\{I_k\}\)</span>, in an equilibrium sense, for the <span class="math inline">\(c &gt; 0\)</span> case.</p>

<div id="simulation" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>The features of this model can be studied via a simulation exercise, in the spirit of agent-based modeling. I’ve made the code available on my <a href="https://github.com/sirallen/college-admissions-toy-model">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For the simulation I construct a set of <span class="math inline">\(K = 50\)</span> colleges, each with capacity <span class="math inline">\(A_k = 100\)</span>. There are <span class="math inline">\(\sum_k A_k = 5000\)</span> prospective applicants with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1^2) \\
\widetilde{W}_i \mid W_i \sim \mathcal{N}(W_i, 0.1^2)
\]</span></p>
<p>so that <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1.1^2)\)</span>. The public admission rates are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_k = \left( 1 - \frac{k-1}{K-1} \right) \underline{r} + \frac{k-1}{K-1}\;\overline{r}
\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\((\underline{r}, \overline{r}) = (.05, 1)\)</span>, which corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(I_k = \sum_{j\leq k} A_j / \sum_j A_j\)</span> in this example. The utility function (common to all applicants) has the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
u_i(k) = I_k^{-\beta} + \gamma (K - k)
\]</span></p>
<p>for <span class="math inline">\(\beta &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; 0\)</span>. The latter parameter guarantees that there is a minimum increment in the utility function between consecutively-ranked colleges. I normalize the utilities so that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_k u_i(k)\cdot I_k = 1000\)</span>.</p>
<p>I computed the “results” of this artificial admissions process for a grid of parameter values, which led to some interesting charts:</p>

<!-- Of these, the one that catches my attention is the $(\beta = 2, \gamma = 3, c = 1)$ case, where the admission rates are at least increasing with $k$. For $\alpha \in \{0.1, 0.2\}$, low-type applicants send lots of applications to colleges on the more selective end of the spectrum, driving admission rates down. (Note that there is a sizable "gap" in the choice sets for these types, in that prospects apply to colleges $j < k$ and $j > k$ but not to $k$; likewise the set of types from which colleges receive applications is disconnected.) I expect that in reality it is the high-type applicants who are sending the most applications (on a per-applicant basis), so this is strange. The other results are even more weird so I'm not going to comment further... -->
